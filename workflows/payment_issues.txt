# Payment Issues Resolution Workflow

## Issue Description
Users reporting problems with payments, including failed transactions, double charges, missing credits/vouchers, or payment processing errors.

## Internal Action Steps
1. Check payment processor logs for transaction IDs and error codes
2. Verify payment gateway service status and recent incidents
3. Check for any bank/card declines and their specific error messages
4. Review the user's transaction history for duplicate charges
5. Verify wallet balance updates and transaction records
6. Check for regional payment restrictions or currency conversion issues

## Common Fixes
- Retry failed transactions with transaction logging
- Refund duplicate charges immediately
- Reset payment session cache
- Update payment method details if outdated
- Escalate to payment processor for gateway issues
- Add transaction compensations or credits for affected users

## User Communication Guidelines
- Be transparent about what happened without causing alarm
- Provide clear information about refunds or retry processes
- Tell users exactly what actions they need to take (if any)
- Set realistic expectations for resolution timeframes
- Offer alternative payment methods if applicable
