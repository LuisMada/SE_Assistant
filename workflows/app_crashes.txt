# App Crashes Resolution Workflow

## Issue Description
Users reporting application crashes, freezes, or unexpected closures during use, often losing data or progress as a result.

## Internal Action Steps
1. Review crash logs from analytics platform for stack traces and exception types
2. Check for patterns in device types, OS versions, or app versions experiencing crashes
3. Analyze memory usage patterns and memory leaks
4. Review recent code changes that might have introduced instability
5. Test on devices/configurations matching those in crash reports
6. Check for third-party SDK/library issues or updates

## Common Fixes
- Roll back recent problematic code changes
- Implement memory management improvements
- Update outdated dependencies or libraries
- Add additional error handling around crash points
- Implement graceful degradation for problematic features
- Release hotfix for critical crash issues

## User Communication Guidelines
- Acknowledge the frustration of losing progress
- Be specific about which conditions trigger the crash (if known)
- Provide clear workarounds if available
- Set expectations for when a fix will be available
- Consider compensation for lost progress/data where appropriate
