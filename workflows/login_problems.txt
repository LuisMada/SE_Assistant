# Login Problems Resolution Workflow

## Issue Description
Users are reporting problems with account login, including failed login attempts, password reset issues, or inability to access their accounts.

## Internal Action Steps
1. Check server logs for failed login attempts and error patterns
2. Verify the authentication service is running properly
3. Check for recent deployments that might have affected login functionality
4. Test login on multiple devices and through different networks
5. Review any third-party authentication services (Google, Facebook, etc.)
6. Check database connection for user accounts

## Common Fixes
- Restart authentication microservice if errors are seen
- Clear cache in Redis for affected users
- Reset user sessions in the database
- Temporarily disable any new authentication security measures for testing

## User Communication Guidelines
- Acknowledge the problem without blaming the user
- Avoid technical details that aren't relevant to the user
- Provide a clear timeline for resolution if available
- Offer alternate methods to access important features if possible
- Follow up when the issue is resolved
